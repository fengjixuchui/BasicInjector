# BasicInjector

There's a ton of DLL injectors out there.  Most of them have a hundred features that you honestly don't need and will never use.

This is a really simple injector, with absolutely no customization or options, other than the target process, and the DLL.  That's it.  Because you _(probably)_ don't need any other options.
